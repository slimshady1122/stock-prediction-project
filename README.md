Stock Price Prediction Using Neural Networks
This project predicts future stock prices using technical indicators and a neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The dataset used in this project includes stock data for Apple (AAPL), and the model forecasts future prices based on past price movements and technical indicators such as Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Relative Strength Index (RSI).


Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
Files and Scripts
data_collection.py: Collects and stores historical stock price data for Apple.
data_preprocessing.py: Cleans the stock data, handles missing values, and calculates technical indicators like SMA, EMA, and RSI.
neural_network_model.py: Defines and trains a neural network model using past stock data to predict future stock prices.
future_predictions.py: Loads the trained model and makes future predictions based on new data.
apple_stock_data.csv: Contains the historical Apple stock data.
apple_stock_data_with_indicators.csv: Contains the preprocessed stock data with technical indicators.
future_stock_predictions.csv: Outputs the future stock price predictions generated by the model.
Usage
1. Data Collection
To collect historical stock data, use the data_collection.py script. Ensure you have the data saved in the required format (CSV) for further steps. This project uses the apple_stock_data.csv file for Apple's historical stock data.

2. Data Preprocessing
Run data_preprocessing.py to clean the data, handle missing values, and add technical indicators. The script adds indicators like:

Simple Moving Average (SMA_20)
Exponential Moving Average (EMA_20)
Relative Strength Index (RSI_14)
These indicators will be used as features in the neural network model.

3. Model Training
To train the model, run the neural_network_model.py script. This script:

Loads the preprocessed data.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Defines a neural network model with Dense and Dropout layers.
Trains the model using past stock data and technical indicators to predict stock prices.
Visualizes the actual vs. predicted stock prices.
The trained model is saved as stock_prediction_model.h5 for later use.

4. Making Future Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can make future predictions using future_predictions.py. This script:

Loads the pre-trained model (stock_prediction_model.h5).
Uses new stock data to predict future stock prices.
Outputs the predictions in future_stock_predictions.csv.
5. Visualization
To visualize the predicted prices against actual prices, the neural_network_model.py script also includes a plotting feature using matplotlib. This helps you to visually inspect the model's performance.

Technical Indicators Used
Simple Moving Average (SMA): A simple average of stock prices over a specified period.
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): A weighted moving average that gives more importance to recent prices.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.
Future Work
Additional Stock Data: You can expand the project by adding data from other companies or sectors.
Improved Model Architecture: Experiment with different neural network architectures or hyperparameters for better performance.
Feature Engineering: Add more technical indicators or external features (e.g., news sentiment) to improve predictions.
